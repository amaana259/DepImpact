**DEPIMPACT (Week 6/Week 3):**Â 

---

- Last week, I was having difficulty understanding how to run the tool for .dot files (instead of .txt files), as my runs resulted in JVM Heap Memory errors.

- This week, I continued work on my VM image. I was able to compile the results for most of the datasets with .dot files.

- Compiled a Sheet with all of the results and comparison: [Work](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E0TT0AYXQ6it_D7pTOyLQqKlCkcLaQbQxC85G6OtyTM/edit?usp=sharing)

- Was able to complete the results for Trace, DataLeak, Shellshock, VPNFilter and FiveDirections.

- Was not able to complete results for Theia, First5Cases and Case67.

Last week, I ran into JVM Heap Memory issues while running Theia for example.

I tried increasing the memory allotted, but the dataset is far too large to process on my machine.

Not sure how to continue for large datasets like Theia and the First5Cases.

There also seems to be a dataset called Firefox-Compress.

Although I have compiled the results for these, I haven't found any mention of these datasets (and their results) in the paper, specifically the results tables included in the paper.

The manual also mentions another .jar file provided to calculate the metrics like FP, FN and to merge the different filtered out dependency graphs.

I assume this file is supposed to provide the metrics for RQ2 and the critical edges (attack entries too), however when run, this file does nothing.

Moreover, the paper mentions 4 RQs and answers them using 4 tables. However, after inspection, RQ1 and RQ3 are verifiable, however RQ2 and RQ4 are not verifiable through the scripts they have provided.

Would have to contact authors regarding this.
